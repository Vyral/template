  about_markdown: |
    Born and raised in South Carolina Les loves to call the Golden Corner Home. Hearing him talk about why he makes this area home leaves no doubt that he is a walking-talking commercial for the area. "I just love everything we have to offer. From the lakes to the mountains, all the local shops and incredible food, comfortable weather all four seasons, and Clemson University in our back door we have something for everyone." says Les.

    Les lives on Lake Keowee and has two daughters. His oldest is a graduate of Clemson University (following in dad's footsteps) and a Special Education Teacher. His younger daughter attends Seneca High School. If he is not helping someone accomplish their real estate dreams, he can be found floating around the lake or taking in an event at Clemson University (Go Tigers!).
